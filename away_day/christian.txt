Equations Over Groups

We will try to give a short introduction to this comprehensive problem,
touching different areas of mathematics and computer science. We will
survey past results and try to illuminate how recent improvements in
combining computer-assisted abstract and combinatorial reasoning might
lead to an interdisciplinary approach for developing new insightful
results in this area.
