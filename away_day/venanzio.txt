QUESTIONS ABOUT TYPE THEORY

Here are 9 questions about the philosophy and structure of type theory. They are the outline of my plan of research for the next few months or years. Each question involves both philosophical issues about the foundations of mathematics and type theory, and technical problems about the structure of type theory.
(1) Can we give a finitary foundation to Type Theory?
(2) How do we implement full reflection?
(3) How do we represent, compute and reason about general recursive functions?
(4) How do we study algorithmic complexity?
(5) Can we extend reduction rules by proven equations?
(6) How do we specify well-foundedness in Wander types?
(7) Can we add constructive principles to Type Theory?
(8) What is the nature of mathematical objects and what is equality?
(9) Can we construct a coinductive model of Homotopy Type Theory?
